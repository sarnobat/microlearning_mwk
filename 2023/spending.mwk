Dirty trick marketing
Deceptive commerce

You can't use a product lying down (eg neck massager)


They don't tell you the new problems introduced that substitutes don't (e.g. dry facewash or dry shampoo or hand sanitizer leaves behind a chemical smell, or different smoothness)

This is often why often not every problem should try to be solved. The culture of spending as a way to solve "needs" prevents us from getting into the habit of balancing the tradeoffs

buying cheap products not only hurts you with acquisition and usage cost (repetitively), but disposal cost. You end up thinking you need to keep it when you probably don't.

I've seen this with usb cables, retaining more than you need (not a great example, since they are actually free but the disposal reluctance is still there).

Also used furniture that is cheap: when it's time to upgrade to something more aesthetically pleasing (because you got married; you are trying to prepare the home for selling), you'll regret the easy to acquire junk product. And ignore indians who waste half a day asking a friend to help them dispose of their furniture without paying for a service.

Address Frequency before addressing amplitude

Reducing node count makes reducing space consumption count easier (like with inodes).

=== laying down a marker ===


#spending

even if you can't pay off overwhelming credit card debt, at least lay the markers down by establishing tiny autopays.

But making them infinite is crippling. They have to be finite so you can hang on to temporary frugality rather than just give up on the plan and dig yourself deeper with blind spending (which I did back in the mid 2010s). Or, paying off everything with a giant lumpsome.

black and white thinking is bad in managing finances

e.g. "since I'm already in credit card debt that I don't know how I'll pay off now that I've lost my job, I might as well buy the laundry hamper to replace the one I gave to my girlfriend" instead of trying to manage without the extra laundry hamper until I get a new job.

The lack of restraints makes it worse. When I have the restraint of needing to pay off a credit card item when my next paycheck arrives, I use the credit card more judiciously.

a worthwhile purchase would be something you're still paying off the credit card debt for even though the product has lost its initial excitement.

consider non-premium products as stop-gap products until you can afford the premium one.

e.g. genuine apple cables vs generic cables from no-name brands

if it's worth paying for both spaced out over time (or you may not need the expensive one later), buy the cheap one first. If you are going to have to buy the expensive one eventually, you might as well get it now (also reducing junk in your home that you keep "just in case").

That said I can't think of any cheap experiment product that was worthwhile. The closest is white boots for a girlfriend. If they look good, then buy an expensive one. But even that's not convincing because the expensive one may become more palatable later, or even have resale value

If so, it's probably a worthwhile purchase because you are more confident that it has a positive ROI and thus not leave you worse off than you current are.

When we say spending money feels like an accomplishment, I think what we mean is that it's something that is easy, and has a definitive done marker (e.g. order receipt). Other things don't have this, especially difficult ones.

The purchasing page has a task-oriented design.

If only there was a transaction processing system for errands like with an "order" button etc. so it feels sensually like a task is completed. The only alternative is to put a big green checkmark on a sticky note.

Skill to rich vs skill to poor

The same applies to marketing for big and small companies

When your marketing budget is low, place your ads in cheap places that get low conversion rates but do lots of them. One of them will be a hit and achieve your goals.

When your marketing budget is high, place your ads in expensive places with high conversation rates. It will almost always achieve your goals.

It's also the same with investing in stocks. Would you rather invest in a high risk high reward ETF with lots of companies or a low risk low reward ETF containing few companies. In the end they probably achieve the same thing.

Maybe this is what's meant with Defensive vs offensive warfare. One is just preserving your status by spending a lot of money, while the other keeps looking for inroads that have a low success rate but done often enough something will work. Success is when you run out of ways to fail. Fail fast, fail often.

It looks like this applies to a lot of domains:

(-) personal finance
(-) company strategy
(-) career success

Another test for investing in quality:

Do you have a massive TBR ("to be read") pile? You're not alone

The problem with all of these items is that they are quick to purchase, but take a long time to use.

How many more games will you impulse-buy before you've finished that one? How many skeins of yarn will you snap up (they were on sale! And so soft!) before you've finished the sweater you're currently knitting? It's the same problem as the TBR pile, really. And I promise, there is a solution.

But did I buy those books? I did not. Anytime I was tempted to buy a book or put in a library request, I instead added it to my "Want to read" list on Goodreads. (Feel free to keep a note in your phone instead, or whatever works for you.)

Spending Now to Save Later

It's about locating the right product or service that will provide the greatest long-term benefit. This often represents a higher up-front cost but will provide a greater saving through the lack of maintenance and replacement that is required. Higher performing and higher quality parts, products and services provide greater safety, productivity and economic outcomes. Certified and compliant products are designed and tested for performance, this bares a greater cost but will save money and injury in the long run.

Other items are worth paying more for too, like luggage - "it gets beaten up at airports so quality construction is important,"

When it comes down to it, time often equals money, so if a more expensive item is indeed higher quality and can last longer, then that's a good reason to pay more for it.

Take a new mattress: A $1,200 one could potentially last for 20 years or more, while you'll likely need to replace a $200 mattress in four or five years

Online reviews can be great, but they're only step one if you really want to get the best product out there for you. The best way to get the right product is to try them for yourself, at home, and compare them to one another. 

I start by looking at reviews, comparisons, polls (like our Hive Five series), and forum posts and compile a list of two or three items that might fit my needs.
2. I then buy all the products on my list, focusing on stores with good return policies. For headphones, HeadRoom is a great choice, and a lot of manufacturers (like Audioengine) have a 30-day guarantee that is just perfect for this. Shop around and read return policies. Clothing stores like Zappos are also really good about this.

Once all the items have arrived, I give them each a short trial period. In the case of things like headphones, I try to compare them side-by-side as well, so I can really hear the differences between each model.
4. When I'm done, I return the ones I don't like. Simple as that.

Unfortunately, less initial spend can lead to greater spending down the line --- whether it's for maintenance and upkeep, or replacement costs when you have to buy the same cheap product or service over and over again. If you really want to save money, increase productivity and safety there are situations when it makes sense to spend more money for quality, so you don't run into the ongoing costs.

how can I avoid unnecessary purchases online?

Here are some tips to avoid unnecessary purchases online:
1. Make a list: Before shopping online, make a list of what you need and stick to it. This can help you avoid impulse purchases.
2. Set a budget: Decide on a budget before you start shopping and stick to it. This can help you avoid overspending.
3. Wait before making a purchase: When you find something you want to buy, wait a day or two before making the purchase. This can help you avoid impulse purchases.
4. Compare prices: Compare prices from different websites before making a purchase. This can help you get the best deal.
5. Read reviews: Read reviews from other customers before making a purchase. This can help you avoid buying something that doesn't meet your expectations.
6. Avoid shopping when you're bored: Shopping can be a way to pass the time when you're bored. If you find yourself browsing online stores out of boredom, find a different activity to occupy your time.
7. Unsubscribe from marketing emails: If you find that you're tempted to buy things because of marketing emails you receive, unsubscribe from those emails to avoid the temptation.
8. Use ad-blockers: Use an ad-blocker on your web browser to avoid seeing ads that might tempt you to make unnecessary purchases.

accumulating is more exciting than ownership

I looked for a book on java security not remember I'd just bought one on web security and hadn't read any of it yet.

There's more joy in collecting and imagining the result than the reality of the result already being the state.

I guess it's the same with storytelling. Imagination is unlimited, reality is not.

Implication: try to find joy in what you have. Though it takes more effort than the marketing that pushes unpurchased products into your visibility. You almost need a store front for what you own instead of what you feel like buying. Hmmm, this should be a product concept (albeit not a profitable. In fact it’s anti-profitability).

Inventory, owned, decluttering into a country club etc. are all the mirror image of commerce within your own home.

It shows progress

#purchasing

If you're willing to settle for a cheap product (that is non-perishable), you should ask yourself if you should buy it at all (it may be harder to offload than it looks)

Then again, there are cheap experiments that need to be performed. If the cheap product is not cheap enough to be a cheap experiment, maybe you need to keep looking for a cheaper one.

It doesn't matter how much you spend to travel to India. The money is amortized over the period the memory lasts, which can be extremely long

=== buying cheap for fear of vandalism ===
#finance
#spending

I think one reason I didn't used to buy the best quality products is because I expected them to be vandalized by people at boarding school. I can't say for sure but if iPhones existed back then I'd have probably bought an Android.  I think some of the day students had more glamorous products.

=== guilt in spending is unfounded ===
#spending
#finance


guilt when a lot of money is spent (often necessarily - e.g. flight ticket cancellation fees, last minute tickets)

positive: you don't get lured into reckless unmeasured spending

negative: long term, it takes a toll on your health

this is why I had bought the book "don't sweat the small stuff about money"

Buying something new is exciting because you imagine how much better your life will be (when usually it isn't) with that product in your possession.

Also the anticipation (which is why in reality it's better to want than own)

=== resist full payoff ===
#spending
#finance

It might begetter not to pay off credit card debt when you get a big check (e.g. tax refund) because your bank balance will fluctuate too much and you can't go onto autopilot.

But holding cash plus debt has its downsides. Maybe schedule a payoff in installments (too quickly or too slowly is a delicate balance though)

=== nowhere to go from the best ===

#spending

Buying premium products takes you out of the spending treadmill. You end up with needs fulfilled to the point that sensual product display and purchasing experiences for inferior products can't be justified. You therefore resist the retail therapy despite it still being alluring. Any dreaming of the perfect product is ruinednjg le by logic

Before using a credit card for a transaction, make sure you know where the payoff funds are going to come from. If you don't know, you shouldn't use the credit card. If it's ultimatley from savings, you might as well use the savings immediately and bypass the credit card.

That said, the pain of the credit card balance may be better feedback than just burning through savings guilt-free

=== unknown is more exciting than reality ===

#spending

We find the unknown limitless.

This is both good and bad. It increases our fear. But it also is imagined to be better than reality. This is why our desire to keep buying more and more never ends.

What we already own is limited in its potential - because we know what those are.

#spending
manipulation

product display manipulation to undermine rational decisions

not showing cables, chargers or batteries

e.g. electric scooter needs charging

showing a white background
showing overlay images of LCD displays instead of actual photos

I'm beginning to think only use websites for fun browsing, never for actual decisions. Make your decisions away from a device (which is why my printouts work).

#spending

using a separate account for small expenses (or at least a common transaction description, like "paypal debit")


it’s the equivalent of moving numerous files to a separate disk, so you can analyze the large expensies without the noise
